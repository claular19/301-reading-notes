Windows 10 is more useful for general use, while a Windows Server helps by managing a bunch of computers and files. Can add specific services like DNS Server and Remote Access
onto a Windows Server. Servers can work in conjunction with one another to work on specific tasks separately. The server can support more powerful hardware. It also has very
limited features with Edge and Cortana not existing on it. Depending on the size of the server you need, paying for the server is necessary and is obviously more expensive than
obtaining Windows 10.
