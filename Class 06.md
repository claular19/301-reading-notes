OSI model demonstrates how computers communicate with each other. The data link layer transfers data on a physical level, using mac addresses. It's separated by the MAC sub layer
and the data link sub layer. The network layer covers how data is efficiently transferred between networks.
Wireshark is used to analyze network protocols by capturing packets of data. It can help with troubleshooting networks by tracing connections inside network traffic. Understanding
of protocols like TCP, DHCP, UDP, and ICMP.

Takeaway: Understanding the OSI model in depth seems like a great way to understand *specifically* how networks run. Wireshark also seems incredibly useful for network 
administrators to understand what's going on inside a network's traffic and find problems.
